## Architecture

Currently, there are four `@RestController`s that show Spring AI features:

`pl.piomin.services.controller.PersonController` - prompt template, chat memory, and structured output based on a simple example that asks AI model to generate some persons

`pl.piomin.services.controller.WalletController` - function calling that calculates a value of our wallet stored in local database in conjunction with the latest stock prices

`pl.piomin.services.controller.StockController` - RAG with a Pinecone vector store and OpenAI based on stock prices API

`pl.piomin.services.controller.ImageController` - image model and multimodality

The architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, focusing on demonstrating how AI features can be incorporated into Spring-based applications.

## Running the Application

Follow these steps to run the application locally. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/piomin/spring-ai-showcase.git
cd spring-ai-showcase
```

By default, this sample Spring AI app connects to OpenAI. So, before running the app you must set a token:
```shell
export OPEN_AI_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To enable integration with Mistral, we should activate the `mistral-ai` profile: 
```shell
export MISTRAL_AI_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
mvn spring-boot:run -Pmistral-ai
```

To enable integration with Ollama, we should activate the `ollama-ai` profile:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pollama-ai
```

Before that, we must run the model on Ollama, e.g.:
```shell
ollama run llava
```

To enable integration with Azure OpenAI, we should activate the `azure-ai` profile and activate the Spring Boot `azure-ai` profile:
```shell
mvn spring-boot:run -Pazure-ai -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=azure-ai
```

To enable integration with Anthropic Claude, we should activate the `anthropic` profile and activate the Spring Boot `anthropic` profile as well:
```shell
export ANTHROPIC_AI_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_TOKEN>
mvn spring-boot:run -Panthropic -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=anthropic
```

You should also export the Azure OpenAI credentials:
```shell
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

For scenarios with a vector store (`StockController`, `ImageController`) you need to export the following ENV:
```shell
export PINECONE_TOKEN=<YOUR_PINECONE_TOKEN>
```

For scenarios with a stock API (`StockController`, `WalletController`) you need to export the following ENV:
```shell
export STOCK_API_KEY=<YOUR_STOCK_API_KEY>
```
